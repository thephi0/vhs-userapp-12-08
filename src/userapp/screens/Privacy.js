              information if it changes or is inaccurate. Typically, we will not
              manually alter your personal information because it is very

              Account activity and in accordance with applicable law. We do
              retain information from closed Accounts in order to comply with
              the law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes,
              troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations of any
              Registered User, enforce our Terms of Use, and take any other
              actions otherwise permitted by law that we deem necessary in our
              sole and absolute discretion. You should understand, however, that
              once you publicly post a Request, Offer, Want, Feedback, or any
              other information onto the Website, you may not be able to change
              or remove it. Once we have deleted or removed your Account, you

              any personal information that was not included within your deleted
              and/or removed Account that remains on the Website.
